abstract: The rapid upsurge of numerical sources of information and the growth
  of storage capacities result in the collection of massive time series
  datasets. Inspired by association rule mining and other rule discovery
  algorithms, a number of approaches have been proposed in the literature to
  discover temporal association rules from time series data. These methods place
  interpretability at the top of their priorities and aim to provide domain
  experts with relevant and qualitative rules. In this paper, we aim to fill the
  gap between tem- poral association rule mining and time series classification
  tasks for the purpose of increasing the interpretability of current classifi-
  cation methods. We propose rule transform (RT), a novel algorithm for
  multivariate time series classification (MTSC) that generates discriminative
  temporal rules for the sake of classification. RT gen- erates a new feature
  space that represents the support of the mined temporal rules which can easily
  be qualitatively interpreted by do- main experts. The algorithm uses temporal
  algebra to extract the most prominent temporal rules from a given dataset. To
  our knowl- edge, this is the first effort to use shapelets as a unit for
  temporal rule mining studies for the purpose of classification. We evaluate
  our proposed approach on an open-source solar flare prediction dataset.
  Results show that RT produces accuracies comparable to state-of-the-art time
  series classification algorithms with the addi- tional interpretability edge.
