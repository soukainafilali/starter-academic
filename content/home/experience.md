    description: This course provides a deep dive into advanced topics in mining texts, graphs, time-series data, vector datasets, and frequent itemset and association rules. The lectures will provide students with a sufficient foundation to apply data mining techniques on massive real-life data repositories using Python. Students will gain hands-on experience in the chosen aspect of the data mining area through the completion of a major data mining project. Topics covered include Node2Vec/Word2Vec models for text and graph embedding, vector space models, time series classifiers, representation learning, data reduction, and association rule mining.

    description: This course provides a broad introduction to state-of-the-art research on data mining, machine learning models, and statistical pattern recognition on time series data. The goal is to learn how to apply, inspect, and evaluate different mining techniques on time series data using Python. Topics covered include time-series representation learning, Fourier and Wavelet transform dimensionality reductions, similarity search, classification, visualization, and frequent patterns mining. Additional coursework is required for students enrolled in the graduate-level course.
